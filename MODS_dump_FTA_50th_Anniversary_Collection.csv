dot:414,,,"Over the past few years\, rising costs and limited budgets have encouraged transit authorities to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the services they provide. The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) and the Tidewater Transportation District Commission (TTDC) are among many properties interested in updating and improving bus service evaluation programs. These programs include a joint review of the state-of-the-art of bus service evaluation techniques across the country. This information will be used to develop bus service evaluating programs for both the MBTA and the TTDC. This report presents the results of a literature review and survey of 71 transit properties in the United States and Canada regarding the evaluation procedures currently in use. The focus of the study was to identify service performance indicators and criteria used to evaluate bus service on a route-by-route basis. Three types of evaluation indicators: service design measures; operating performance measures; and economic or productivity measures\, were identified. The range of standards developed for each indicator are reported. Results are presented separately for transit properties owning less than 400 buses and for those owning more than 400 buses. Detailed appendices provide more complete information on the survey response. These appendices also provide the transit operator and the regional transit planner with a compendium of a wide range of performance measures\, descriptions of how they are used and how the needed data is collected\, a listing of contact persons in each property\, and detailed information on available literature.

dot:555,,,"This research study examines two major issues: 1) the impact of labor union work rules on bus transit operating costs\, and 2) the magnitude of cost savings that can be expected from the use of part-time drivers. These issues are examined within the context of finding ways to reduce transit deficits. The work rules analyzed in this report include restrictions on part-time labor\, changes in spread premium\, and limitations on maximum spread time for drivers. Labor costs were estimated using the RUCUS automated scheduling program which was applied to actual service schedules from five U.S. transit properties. The analysis yielded cost estimates for a total of 45 combinations of work rules and service schedules\, and revealed that: 1) paying spread time after 10 hours\, rather than 12\, boosts labor cost by 4 percent to 7 percent with negligible effect on number of drivers required; 2) the effect of reducing the maximum spread time is highly sensitive to the peak/base ratio and the interval between the morning and evening peak; and 3) savings from the use of part-time labor\, under favorable conditions\, will be in the range of 3 to 8 percent but may be canceled out by wage increases necessary to secure union approval of the change. This report concludes that work rule changes are no panacea for transit deficits; the principal source of deficits is the decision to maintain low fares and low-patronage routes. The appendixes in this report include a glossary of scheduling terminology\, and tables and simplified methods that can be used to estimate the cost effects of work rule changes in a given transit property.

Urban Mass Transportation Administration,Federal Transit Administration 50th Anniversary,This research study examines two major issues: 1) the impact of labor union work rules on bus transit operating costs\, and 2) the magnitude of cost savings that can be expected from the use of part-time drivers. These issues are examined within the context of finding ways to reduce transit deficits. The work rules analyzed in this report include restrictions on part-time labor\, changes in spread premium\, and limitations on maximum spread time for drivers.

This Guide is designed to help transit systems outline and author the sections of a plan in order to implement an effective Security Program. The Guide discusses each aspect of a security plan to ensure that when complete\, the plan document will demonstrate management's commitment and policy regarding security; introduce the concept of a System Security Program; describe the transit system; establish the management of the plan; detail the Security Program by assigning responsibilities; explain how threats and vulnerabilities will be identified\, assessed\, and resolved; describe how the plan itself will be implemented to establish or revise the program; and describe how the Security Plan will be evaluated and modified.

In order to protect passengers\, employees\, revenues\, and property\, all transit systems are encouraged to develop\, implement\, and maintain a System Security Plan and Program. Increased security should be accomplished through the use of a systems approach with both proactive and law enforcement activities clearly outlined in the Security Program Plan. The System Security Program Plan should be a complete\, well thought out guide to establishing and maintaining a comprehensive Security Program for the transit system and the entire system for which it is responsible: this includes people\, property\, procedures\, and environment. This Guide is designed to help transit systems outline and author the sections of a plan in order to implement an effective Security Program. The Guide discusses each aspect of a security plan to ensure that when complete\, the plan document will demonstrate management's commitment and policy regarding security; introduce the concept of a System Security Program; describe the transit system; establish the management of the plan; detail the Security Program by assigning responsibilities; explain how threats and vulnerabilities will be identified\, assessed\, and resolved; describe how the plan itself will be implemented to establish or revise the program; and describe how the Security Plan will be evaluated and modified.

This paper presents the Federal Transit Administration's (FTA) proposal to address the expanded criteria and Executive Order in the Major Investments Policy. While the new policy will have an impact on the local planning procedures required for federally assisted metropolitan area transportation investments\, its primary purpose is to address FTA's appraisal of candidate projects for Section 3 New Starts funds. This is because the new Policy will be used to determine FTA's rating of projects in the Section 3(j) Report to Congress on recommendations for use of Section 3 New Starts funds. The paper is being circulated among interested parties for comments and suggestions.,821",1994-09-01,PDF,,,"Washington (District of Columbia),United States",,2017-08-25T15:32:11.935Z,,Tech Report,,United States.

dot:607,,,"This study examined organizations providing rural transportation services in Wisconsin to determine the difficulty they experienced in obtaining vehicle insurance and then examined insurance management as a means of controlling costs. Organizations involved include private\, non-profit groups; agencies of county governments; commercial taxis; and two Indian tribes. Each fleet average 4.5 vehicles with an annual insurance premium of $2\,500. It was found that coverage is generally adequate with over half buying at the recommended $1 million level. It was recommended that comprehensive liability coverage without limits be purchased\, that there be no liability exclusion for fellow-employee suits; that there be no separate medical payments coverage which duplicates other insurance coverage; and that comprehensive coverage for vehicles be purchased in preference to more restrictive perils coverage. While coverage was found generally available and costs were reasonable\, it was noted that conditions may change. If insurance does become more expensive and harder to find\, it is recommended that more intensive training and safety programs be instituted\, that there be checks of applicant and employee driver records\, and that there be systematic solicitation of competitive bids.

Dept. of Transportation. Office of the Secretary,Wisconsin. Dept. of Transportation. Social Media Peer Exchange Planning Team,Federal Transit Administration 50th Anniversary,This study examined organizations providing rural transportation services in Wisconsin to determine the difficulty they experienced in obtaining vehicle insurance and then examined insurance management as a means of controlling costs. Organizations involved include private\, non-profit groups; agencies of county governments; commercial taxis; and two Indian tribes. Each fleet average 4.5 vehicles with an annual insurance premium of $2\,500. It was found that coverage is generally adequate with over half buying at the recommended $1 million level. It was recommended that comprehensive liability coverage without limits be purchased\, that there be no liability exclusion for fellow-employee suits; that there be no separate medical payments coverage which duplicates other insurance coverage; and that comprehensive coverage for vehicles be purchased in preference to more restrictive perils coverage. While coverage was found generally available and costs were reasonable\, it was noted that conditions may change. If insurance does become more expensive and harder to find\, it is recommended that more intensive training and safety programs be instituted\, that there be checks of applicant and employee driver records\, and that there be systematic solicitation of competitive bids. Social-service agencies may find it advantageous to band together with a single insurer to control costs and insure future availability.,835",1984-11-01,PDF,,,"Washington (District of Columbia),United States",,2017-08-25T15:32:51.731Z,,Tech Report,,United States.

The elements of these are included in this report as unified recommendations for enhancing transit security.,835",1995-03-01,PDF,,,"Philadelphia (Pennsylvania),United States",,2017-08-25T15:24:57.319Z,,Tech Report,,United States.

Chapters 3-10 present detailed case studies describing the implementation of exclusive busways\, transitways\, and other bus and carpool priority schemes in seven North American metropolitan areas (New York\, San Francisco-Oakland\, Ottawa-Carleton\, Pittsburgh\, Washington\, D.C.\, Los Angeles-Long Beach-Orange County\, and Houston). Chapter 2 provides less extensive evaluations of schemes implemented in other areas. Chapters 14 and 15 compare the cost-effectiveness of exclusive busways and bus-HOV facilities with the cost- effectiveness of recently completed light and heavy rail lines. Finally\, Chapters 11-13 consider the problems of serving large downtown areas\, something that many observers view as the Achilles heel of all-bus systems.,955",1992-01-01,PDF,,,"Massachusetts,United States",,2017-08-25T15:21:40.557Z,,Tech Report,,United States.

dot:523,,UMTA-URT-30,"This ridership management report documents a new marketing orientation towards the provision of transit service--a behavioral marketing approach. It is a compromise between 2 approaches (consumer and product) and based upon principles of behavioral psychology. The study focuses on short term economic incentives\, namely\, promotional pricing--a short term pricing policy aimed at influencing a consumer to try a particular product. The economic incentives discussed in this report are an extension of promotional pricing and refer to the broad range of pricing manipulations\, both fare-related (free fare\, reduced fare\, etc.) and non-fare related (rebates and coupons for discount on merchandise\, service\, etc.). Private sector involvement in supporting transit is strongly encouraged and viewed as one of the primary purposes of these incentive programs. The purpose of this document is to give the reader an overview of the variety\, type\, and nature of short-term economic incentive programs implemented by transit systems. Several examples of economic incentive programs designed to promote transit are reviewed along with a framework/perspective for understanding these case studies. The framework was derived from psychological research and practice (reinforcement theory)\, and from contemporary marketing and management perspectives. The 14 case studies reviewed illustrate the range of incentive programs implemented and highlight the more successful methods by which the reinforcement theory might be integrated with modern marketing and management approaches.

The Workshop's goals were to establish greater awareness and understanding of the current accessibility issues; identify and resolve the key problems experienced in providing accessible service; and develop a workable set of industry guidelines for wheelchair lifts\, securement devices\, and ramps. The Conference addressed the options available to serve elderly and handicapped transit users: full-size lift-equipped buses on conventional routes and smaller vans and accessible buses in specialized supplemental service. Issues of safety\, reliability and cost were discussed\, as well as operationally-linked concerns. Questions of stability and crashworthiness arose pertaining to the small buses and paratransit vehicles.

It defines alternative operating strategies and stopping policies that can improve transit productivity and demonstrates (through examples) how these strategies can be applied to reduce costs and improve performance. Service strategies discussed are intended for moderate-to-high demand corridors that have a strong directional orientation (toward the central business district or a rapid-transit station. The corridor definition is 8 or more busloads per hour cumulative passenger volume for all routes serving it. The strategies are intended only for use during the periods when corridor demand meets this qualification. This overview report is primarily descriptive and is to be followed by detailed planning manuals. Chapters of this volume discuss the use of express service\, how local bus operation can be customized and refined to achieve more efficient operation\, and how deadheading and interlining among corridor routes can reduce vehicle requirements.,1389",1984-05-01,PDF,,,North Carolina;United States,,2017-08-25T15:27:52.081Z,,Tech Report,Final Report,United States.

They serve all classes\, from affluent white collar workers seeking a more comfortable trip to work to some of the regions lowest paid workers who merely want to get to work on time. Another important finding is that the new locally-generated modes hold the promise of providing a superior service at lower cost than does the public operation in specific corridors\, mostly in the least dense portions of the region where the costs of regular bus service are high.

One of the most important findings of this study is the extent and pervasive nature of these new travel modes in the New York area. They serve all classes\, from affluent white collar workers seeking a more comfortable trip to work to some of the regions lowest paid workers who merely want to get to work on time. Another important finding is that the new locally-generated modes hold the promise of providing a superior service at lower cost than does the public operation in specific corridors\, mostly in the least dense portions of the region where the costs of regular bus service are high. Existing private bus lines were found to be only slightly more cost efficient as compared to public operations. It is suggested that significant amounts of money would be saved by the public sector and a better level of service achieved if the operations were authorized along some of the low density routes.,1389",1987-01-01,PDF,,,United States;New York Metropolitan Area,,2017-08-25T15:29:46.735Z,,Tech Report,,United States.

dot:568,,,"The Transit Mall Pedestrian/Parking Survey is one of three surveys assessing the Portland Downtown Transit Mall. The primary purposes of the Transit Mall Pedestrian/Parking Survey are to measure attitudes toward the Mall and to measure the impacts of the Mall on people driving and parking Downtown for reasons other than work. The survey was based on a geographic cluster sampling of pedestrians who had driven and parked Downtown. The survey was limited to eleven locations Downtown: eight on the Transit Mall and three locations within 2 1/2 blocks of the Mall. In-person interviews lasting approximately five minutes were conducted with 302 qualified respondents. A key consideration in the design of the survey was measuring attitudes from different demographic groups. Thus equal numbers of men and women were surveyed and a cross section of respondents in all age groups were interviewed. Because respondents were selected to some degree on the basis of age and sex\, and at only eleven locations Downtown\, the survey population may not be an actual respondent profile of all people who drive and park Downtown for reasons other than work. Demographic differences in responses are noted throughout the report. In addition\, a complete demographic breakdown of questionnaire results is included.

The primary purposes of the Transit Mall Pedestrian/Parking Survey are to measure attitudes toward the Mall and to measure the impacts of the Mall on people driving and parking Downtown for reasons other than work. The survey was based on a geographic cluster sampling of pedestrians who had driven and parked Downtown. The survey was limited to eleven locations Downtown: eight on the Transit Mall and three locations within 2 1/2 blocks of the Mall. In-person interviews lasting approximately five minutes were conducted with 302 qualified respondents. A key consideration in the design of the survey was measuring attitudes from different demographic groups. Thus equal numbers of men and women were surveyed and a cross section of respondents in all age groups were interviewed. Because respondents were selected to some degree on the basis of age and sex\, and at only eleven locations Downtown\, the survey population may not be an actual respondent profile of all people who drive and park Downtown for reasons other than work. Demographic differences in responses are noted throughout the report. In addition\, a complete demographic breakdown of questionnaire results is included. This report is divided into the following sections: Conclusions - Summary of the major findings of the survey; Questionnaire Results - Complete listing of the demographic breakdowns of the survey results; Methodology - Summary of the methodology employed in the survey; and Questionnaire: A copy of the questionnaire used in the survey.,1389",1981-12-01,PDF,,,Portland (Oregon);United States,,2017-08-25T15:29:32.595Z,,Tech Report,,"United States.

Community-based transit and paratransit services may provide a promising alternative to conventional public transit in serving local travel in these areas.

Community-based transit and paratransit services may provide a promising alternative to conventional public transit in serving local travel in these areas. The establishment of such services typically requires an assessment of financial feasibility\, which in turn requires sound estimates of ridership and revenues. This handbook pulls together several existing (and some enhanced) estimation techniques that are applicable in planning community transit services. Several simple techniques are presented for preliminary planning stages or for situations in which exact estimates are not required. More sophisticated techniques also are included for the more detailed estimates required for the later stages of some planning studies. The techniques are illustrated\, and case studies are presented that illustrate their combined application in different planning situations.,1389",1984-10-01,PDF,,,United States,,2017-08-25T15:17:48.702Z,,Tech Report,Final Report,United States.

dot:455,,,"This study reports the results of an analysis of the potential cost impacts of private sector service contracting by transit agencies as well as the results of a nationwide survey of the magnitude and characteristics of existing transit service contracting. Using cost models developed during the study\, an evaluation was made of the cost impacts of contracting out 5 to 20 percent of the existing services of 19 medium and large transit agencies\, and all service of 3 small agencies. This evaluation determined that large agencies would save 2 to 49 percent of the costs of the contracted service\, with a mean savings of 28 percent\, and that medium size agencies would save up to 31 percent of the cost of service they contracted\, with a mean savings of 14 percent. No cost savings were indicated for some small and medium agencies. A separate analysis of potential cost savings\, using a statistical model developed from data supplied by agencies which currently contract for fixed-route bus service\, predicted that agencies of 100 or more vehicles would save 26 percent of the cost of contracted services. The nationwide survey of transit contracting found that 35 percent of all public agencies responsible for transit currently contract for some or all of their transit service.

dot:625,,,"Suburban mobility is one of the most critical transportation problems facing American cities today. The purpose of this research project is to develop an understanding of the suburban activity center (SAC) mobility problems and the ways that public and private entities are addressing these problems. The project has two objectives: 1. Develop a data base on suburban activity centers and CBDs which documents characteristics of the centers\, their mobility needs\, transportation actions\, and identifies the local private and public organizational and financing arrangements used to implement these actions. 2.

The purpose of this research project is to develop an understanding of the suburban activity center (SAC) mobility problems and the ways that public and private entities are addressing these problems. The project has two objectives: 1. Develop a data base on suburban activity centers and CBDs which documents characteristics of the centers\, their mobility needs\, transportation actions\, and identifies the local private and public organizational and financing arrangements used to implement these actions. 2. Develop the basis for identifying potential roles that the Urban Mass Transportation Administration\, state and local governments\, transit agencies and the private sector can assume in the financing\, management\, and the negotiation of agreements to solve mobility needs of suburban activity centers.

dot:595,,,"The Urban Mass Transportation Administration (UMTA) Section 15 program helps meet information needs in planning for public transportation services and making investment decisions at the Federal\, State\, and local levels. The goal is to provide an accurate and validated transit information database in a timely manner. Since the information collected in this program will effect public policy for many years\, your cooperation to provide accurate data is essential. The enclosed reporting forms are designed to help you report as easily as possible while establishing uniformity. The forms record information in several areas. The initial series of forms\, the 000 series\, establish a basic agency profile. The 100 series summarize financial information and detail the origin and amount of an agency's capital funding.

dot:41998,,,"The Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA)\, Section 3019 included the provisions for the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) Turnkey Demonstration Program. The FTA is responsible through Section 3019 to develop turnkey guidelines based on the comparative cost and schedule differences between conventional and turnkey projects. To assist FTA in meeting this legislative requirement numerous outreach activities were initiated\, highlighted by the International Transit Turnkey and Joint Development Workshop in San Juan\, Puerto Rico on October 15-19\, 1996. Co-hosted by FTA\, the Transportation Research Board (TRB) and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico\, this 5-day conference featured experts from around the world and explored the use of turnkey in transit projects development and implementation.

Federal Transit Administration,Federal Transit Administration 50th Anniversary,The Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA)\, Section 3019 included the provisions for the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) Turnkey Demonstration Program. The FTA is responsible through Section 3019 to develop turnkey guidelines based on the comparative cost and schedule differences between conventional and turnkey projects. To assist FTA in meeting this legislative requirement numerous outreach activities were initiated\, highlighted by the International Transit Turnkey and Joint Development Workshop in San Juan\, Puerto Rico on October 15-19\, 1996. Co-hosted by FTA\, the Transportation Research Board (TRB) and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico\, this 5-day conference featured experts from around the world and explored the use of turnkey in transit projects development and implementation. Under the direction of the FTA\, 6 resource papers were produced addressing the core subjects of Financing: Project Management Control; Identification and Management of Risk; Value Engineering and Quality Assurance/Quality Control; Procurement and Environmental Considerations.

dot:14005,,DTNH22-96-C-05101,"In an effort to reduce the high crash rate and resulting injuries of young drivers\, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has sponsored research to assess the factors responsible for this heightened crash risk and to determine the implications for traffic safety programs. As part of this research\, this review of research literature was conducted to determine what is known about cognitive development and information processing capabilities of youth. The goal of the project was to ascertain how traffic safety programs should be structured to match these cognitive characteristics. The review is divided into 12 sections. This literature review focuses primarily on cognitive development from about 10 to 24 years of age. The first section is about memory; that is\, the processes that allow a person to retain knowledge over time. The second section\, attention\, discusses the factors related to the development of how people focus cognitive resources on perceptual or mental tasks\, including selective\, divided\, and sustained attention. The third section\, learning\, discusses the processes by which people acquire information. The fourth section\, reasoning\, discusses types of reasoning and the problems young people have with this type of thinking. The fifth section\, motivation\, examines the factors that initiate and influence the intensity of behaviors. The sixth section is a discussion of the development of risk perception and factors that contribute to the misperception of risk.

As part of this research\, this review of research literature was conducted to determine what is known about cognitive development and information processing capabilities of youth. The goal of the project was to ascertain how traffic safety programs should be structured to match these cognitive characteristics. The review is divided into 12 sections. This literature review focuses primarily on cognitive development from about 10 to 24 years of age. The first section is about memory; that is\, the processes that allow a person to retain knowledge over time. The second section\, attention\, discusses the factors related to the development of how people focus cognitive resources on perceptual or mental tasks\, including selective\, divided\, and sustained attention. The third section\, learning\, discusses the processes by which people acquire information. The fourth section\, reasoning\, discusses types of reasoning and the problems young people have with this type of thinking. The fifth section\, motivation\, examines the factors that initiate and influence the intensity of behaviors. The sixth section is a discussion of the development of risk perception and factors that contribute to the misperception of risk. The seventh section discusses the development of problem solving and decision making in a general way. While influenced by all other cognitive factors and their age-related limitations\, general deficits of problem solving and decision making ability are discussed. The eighth section\, social cognition\, covers those topics in the development of social cognition that are likely to have an effect on driving: attribution theory and social schemata/scripts.
